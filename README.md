# Hi, I'm Nikhitha 👋

🎓 MS student focused on data-driven problem solving across analytics and machine learning, with strengths in turning raw, messy datasets into clean, reliable pipelines and clear insights. 💻 I build end-to-end projects using Python and SQL, covering data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, visualization, and model development (including ML/CV), and I prioritize results that are measurable, explainable, and easy for stakeholders to use. 📊 I’m comfortable working across the full workflow from data ingestion to evaluation and documentation. 🤝 I’m always open to collaborating with others and exploring new opportunities in Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and ML/AI Engineer roles.

## ✨ Highlights
- 🔍 Strong in **EDA, data cleaning, and storytelling** — turning raw data into clear insights & recommendations  
- 🧠 Built **ML/CV models** with solid evaluation practices (metrics, validation, error analysis)  
- 🛠️ Comfortable building **end-to-end pipelines**: ingestion → preprocessing → features → modeling → documentation  
- 📈 Create stakeholder-friendly outputs using **visualizations, notebooks, and well-structured reports**  
- 🤝 Team-friendly: enjoy **collaborating**, documenting work clearly, and improving projects iteratively
